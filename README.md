# guitarBot

This repo is a part of my master's project at the Robotics Musicianship Lab, GTCMT. It contains different implementations to work the guitar robot.

1. MIDI playback: Input any midifile to play it back on the guitar robot
2. Super-human capability demonstration: The system can read multiple voicings from any given choarle by JS Bach and can play all of them simultaneuosly on the guitar robot. This demonstration was built to explore super-human playing capabilities of the robot as its fretting hand is different from that of a human
3. A basic autoencoder trained on Wikifonia Lead sheets dataset for accompaniment generation to any given melody.

These things were developed in my first semester and provided a basis for me to explore my actual research question:
Can we build a system that learns a robot's physical constraints and composes music suited to its embodiment, instead of what a human would play?
